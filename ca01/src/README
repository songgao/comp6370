This program implements a simple encryption algorithm as described in CA01 from
Dr. Umphress's COMP6370 class in Fall 2014.

The Makefile's default target is to produce "encrypt" binary. Type "./encrypt
-h" for usage info. The default (without any flags) is to use "plain.txt" as
input file and write result into "result.txt".

"run" is another target defined in the Makefile that builds the program, run
it, and clean up target files and the binary.
